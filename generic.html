            <h3 class="major">When did life on Earth begin?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              Earth is about 4.5 billion years old. Scientists think that by 4.3
              billion years ago, Earth may have developed conditions suitable to
              support life. The oldest known fossils, however, are only 3.7
              billion years old. During that 600 million-year window, life may
              have emerged repeatedly, only to be snuffed out by catastrophic
              collisions with asteroids and comets. The details of those early
              events are not well preserved in Earth’s oldest rocks. Some hints
              come from the oldest zircons, highly durable minerals that formed
              in magma. Scientists have found traces of a form of carbon—an
              important element in living organisms—in one such 4.1
              billion-year-old zircon. However, it does not provide enough
              evidence to prove life’s existence at that early date.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">
              The early days on Earth looked very different from today—it was
              extremely hot, volcanically active, and bathed in brutal UV
              radiation. Since we don’t have fossils from this time, scientists
              can look at life forms that still exist today in similar
              conditions. From these, they have suggested possibilities where
              life first began.

            <h3 class="major">What are Constellations?</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
              There are a few different definitions of constellations, but many
              people think of constellations as a group of stars. The
              constellations you can see at night depend on your location on
              Earth and the time of year. Constellations were named after
              objects, animals, and people long ago. Astronomers today still use
              constellations to name stars and meteor showers.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  The Orion constellation, a prominent and easily recognizable
                  grouping of stars in the night sky, is named after the
                  legendary Greek hunter Orion. It's known for its distinctive
                  hourglass shape, particularly due to the prominent Orion's
                  Belt, and is visible throughout the world, especially during
                  the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.

                <p style="text-align: justify">
                  Ursa Major, also known as the Great Bear, is a prominent
                  constellation in the Northern Hemisphere, easily recognizable
                  by its distinctive shape, which resembles a large bear. It's
                  one of the largest of the 88 constellations and contains the
                  well-known Big Dipper asterism. Ursa Major is visible
                  year-round, with optimal viewing occurring in April.
